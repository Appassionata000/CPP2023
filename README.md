<!-- ## Assignment description

### Assignment 1

Calculate the electron transition energy in the Bohr model
$E_{i j}=13.6 Z^2\left[\frac{1}{n_j^2}-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right] \mathrm{eV}$ 
by asking the user to enter the atomic number, and initial and final quantum numbers,
and then ask the user whether to print out the energy of the transition in J or eV.

Programming skills: Basic calculation. Input validation.
